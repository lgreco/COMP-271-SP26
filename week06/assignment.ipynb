    "\n",
    "- It creates a new Node.\n",
    "- If the list is empty, the new node becomes the `head`.\n",
    "- Otherwise, it starts at the `head` and repeatedly follows next pointers:<br/>\n",

    "\n",
    "Your task is to suggest a faster design by modifying class `LinkedList` so it can attach a new node to the end without having to start at the head and follow a long chain every time. Describe the rationale for your modification in the _doctstring_ for the `LinkedList` class.\n"
