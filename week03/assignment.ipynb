Python treats functions as _first class values._ This is a bit of an advanced concept for now, so take `__contain_by` and the `contains_first_name`, `contains_last_name`, and `contains_role` as given and guaranteed to work. If you'd like to learn more about the topic, you can start with the [Wikipedia entry for first-class values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function). For more, plan to take Konstantin Laufer's _Programming Languages_ class -- you can thank me later.\n",
