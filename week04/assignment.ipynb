    "\n",
    "### Adding just a `Character` to a `Cast` object\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify method `Cast.add_character` to add a `[None, Character]` record to the `__underlying` list. This will allow the method to continue working even when we add only a character but we do not have information about the corresponding actor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding just an `Actor` to the `Cast` object\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Rename `Cast.add_unique` to `Cast.add_unique_character` to add a record `[None, Character]` only if the `Character` object is unique within the underlying list.\n",

    "\n",
    "- If the `__underlying` list has an entry for `[None, Character]` that matches the character information in the header **and** no entry `[Actor, None]` that matches the actor information in the header, create a `Actor` object with the specified information and update the `[None, Character]` entry to `[Actor, Character]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the `__underlying` list has an entry for `[Actor, Character]` that matches the character information **and** the actor information in the header, do nothing.\n",
