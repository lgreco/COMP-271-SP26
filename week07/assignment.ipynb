    "#### Verify State Before and After Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Good tests do not just check the final result of a method call. They verify how the object’s **state changes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call a method like `add_item()` or `remove_item()`, something about the object should change — or explicitly *not* change.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the `count()` before adding an item?\n",
    "* What should it be after?\n",
    "* If `add_item()` returns `False` because the backpack is full, did the contents remain unchanged?\n",
    "* If `remove_item()` fails, is the state identical to what it was before?\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing only the return value is often not enough. A method could return the correct boolean but still corrupt the internal state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Strong tests check both the return value and the state transition. That is how you verify behavior, not just output. A **state transition** is a change in an object’s internal condition caused by an operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The “state” of a `Backpack` consists of things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How many items it currently contains\n",
    "* Which items are inside\n",
    "* Whether it is full or not\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time you call a method like `add_item()` or `remove_item()`, the backpack may move from one state to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 1: Adding an Item\n",
    "\n",
    "Before:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `count()` is 2\n",
    "* `items()` is `[\"book\", \"pencil\"]`\n",
    "* `is_full()` is `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "After calling:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "b.add_item(\"notebook\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `count()` is 3\n",
    "* `items()` is `[\"book\", \"pencil\", \"notebook\"]`\n",
    "* `is_full()` may still be `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "That change is a state transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 2: Adding When Full\n",
    "\n",
    "Before:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `count()` is 5\n",
    "* `is_full()` is `True`\n",
    "\n",
    "After calling:\n",
    "\n",

    "b.add_item(\"eraser\")\n",

    "\n",
    "If the method returns `False`, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `count()` must still be 5\n",
    "* `items()` must be unchanged\n",
    "* `is_full()` must still be `True`\n",
    "\n",
