    "# Week 05: Abstract Data Types: a Dresser\n",

    "### What it models\n",
    "\n",
    "A **dresser** is a piece of furniture with a **fixed number of drawers**.\n",
    "Each drawer can hold **at most one item** (or be empty).\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a row of labeled compartments: drawer 0, drawer 1, …, drawer _n−1_.\n",
    "\n",
    "## State (conceptual)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dresser has **N drawers** (chosen at construction time; default is 2).\n",
    "- Each drawer is either:\n",
    "  - **empty**, or\n",
    "  - contains an **item** (any object).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core operations (typical interface)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Dresser(n=2)`: create a dresser with `n` empty drawers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observers (don’t change the dresser)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `num_drawers() -> int`: return N.\n",
    "- `is_empty(i) -> bool`: True if drawer _i_ is empty.\n",
    "- `peek(i) -> item | None`: return the item in drawer _i_ without removing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutators (change the dresser)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `put(i, item) -> bool`\n",
    "  Put an item into drawer _i_ **only if it’s empty**. Return True if successful.\n",
    "- `remove(i) -> item | None`\n",
    "  Remove and return the item from drawer _i_. Return None if it was empty.\n",
    "- `clear(i) -> None`\n",
    "  Make drawer _i_ empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preconditions / error rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- Valid drawer index: `0 <= i < N`\n",
    "  - If not, either raise an error or return a failure value. Pick one and be consistent. (Leo's preference: do not raise an error.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, this implementation uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `self.__drawers`: a Python list of length `N`\n",
    "- Each element is initialized to `None` to mean **empty**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  [None, None, None, ...]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Key point: _users of the ADT don’t need to know it’s a list_—they just rely on the behavior promised by the operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Invariant\n",
    "\n",
    "`len(self.__drawers) == N` always, and each entry is either `None` or an item.\n"
